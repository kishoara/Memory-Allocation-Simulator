# Memory-Allocation-Simulator

Memory Allocation Simulator is a C/Python-based simulation of how an Operating System allocates memory blocks to processes.# 🗂️ Memory Allocation Simulator (OS Project)

A simple simulator implementing classic **Operating System memory allocation algorithms**: First-Fit, Best-Fit, and Worst-Fit.  
Built in Python as part of the **Operating Systems** course.

## 🚀 Features

- First-Fit, Best-Fit, Worst-Fit algorithms  
- Shows free/occupied memory blocks  
- Console-based visualization  
- Beginner-friendly OS simulation  

## ▶️ Run

```bash
python3 memory_simulator.py
```

## 📁 Files

- `memory_simulator.py`  
- `README.md`  
- `requirements.txt` (no external dependencies)

## 🧠 Algorithms

- **First Fit:** first free block large enough  
- **Best Fit:** smallest suitable block  
- **Worst Fit:** largest suitable block
